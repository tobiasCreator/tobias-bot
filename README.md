### FAQ

1. This inject something on client? No, this BOT simulates keyboard and mouse, and identify pixels standards on screen. \*\*The unique update of memory is the byte of full light.
2. Why needs internet to use it? We need to check if you are a member on our Discord when you enter your Discord username.
3. This is Paid? You can use it as a free version with limited features.
4. How to fishing? Put the fishing rod on the ammunition spot (arrow icon) and be close to the water.
5. Why open the application as administrator? The application reads the client to get crucial information, like: Position, Health, and the game screen size when the player log in.
6. The application is not safe or trustable, that occurs because Microsoft Windows requires a signed certificate (we don't have yet) and files with few downloads are marked as not trustable. Google it for more details.
7. Works in MAC or Linux? For now, _only WINDOWS_.
